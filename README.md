# I75W-Raymarine-Autopilot
Remote LED Matrix Display for Raymarine autopilots using Pimoroni I75W board

This project uses off-the-shelf hardware to create a daylight-visible display for Raymarine tillerpilots, such as the ST1000+.
The display can used when it is not convenient to view the small display on the tillerpilot, and when there is no other (typically expensive) display available.
