# I75W-Raymarine-Autopilot
Remote LED Matrix Display for Raymarine autopilots using Pimoroni I75W board

This project uses off-the-shelf hardware to create a daylight-visible display for Raymarine tillerpilots, such as the ST1000+.
The display can used when it is not convenient to view the small display on the tillerpilot, and when there is no other (typically expensive) display available.

The display used here is a 64x64 2mm pitch LED Matrix (128x128mm). These are widely available and in different configurations.

The display is not waterproof and will require a case. Later, I'll discuss a case build using low-reflective acrylic. It's possible to buy a waterproof version, but they are expensive - intended for use in outdoor venues such a sports stadiums.
